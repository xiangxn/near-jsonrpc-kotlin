 * @param avgHiddenValidatorSeatsPerShard Expected number of hidden validators per shard.
 * @param blockProducerKickoutThreshold Threshold for kicking out block producers, between 0 and 100.
 * @param chainId ID of the blockchain. This must be unique for every blockchain. If your testnet blockchains do not have unique chain IDs, you will have a bad time.
 * @param chunkProducerKickoutThreshold Threshold for kicking out chunk producers, between 0 and 100.
 * @param dynamicResharding Enable dynamic re-sharding.
 * @param epochLength Epoch length counted in block heights.
 * @param fishermenThreshold Fishermen stake threshold.
 * @param gasLimit Initial gas limit.
 * @param gasPriceAdjustmentRate Gas price adjustment rate
 * @param genesisHeight Height of genesis block.
 * @param genesisTime Official time of blockchain start.
 * @param maxGasPrice 
 * @param maxInflationRate Maximum inflation on the total supply every epoch.
 * @param minGasPrice Minimum gas price. It is also the initial gas price.
 * @param numBlockProducerSeats Number of block producer seats at genesis.
 * @param numBlockProducerSeatsPerShard Defines number of shards and number of block producer seats per each shard at genesis. Note: not used with protocol_feature_chunk_only_producers -- replaced by minimum_validators_per_shard Note: not used before as all block producers produce chunks for all shards
 * @param numBlocksPerYear Expected number of blocks per year
 * @param protocolRewardRate Protocol treasury rate
 * @param protocolTreasuryAccount Protocol treasury account
 * @param protocolVersion Protocol version that this genesis works with.
 * @param totalSupply Total supply of tokens at genesis.
 * @param transactionValidityPeriod Number of blocks for which a given transaction is valid
 * @param validators List of initial validators.
 * @param chunkProducerAssignmentChangesLimit Limits the number of shard changes in chunk producer assignments, if algorithm is able to choose assignment with better balance of number of chunk producers for shards.
 * @param chunkValidatorOnlyKickoutThreshold Threshold for kicking out nodes which are only chunk validators, between 0 and 100.
 * @param maxKickoutStakePerc Max stake percentage of the validators we will kick out.
 * @param minimumStakeDivisor The minimum stake required for staking is last seat price divided by this number.
 * @param minimumStakeRatio The lowest ratio s/s_total any block producer can have. See <https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/167> for details
 * @param minimumValidatorsPerShard The minimum number of validators each shard must have
 * @param numChunkOnlyProducerSeats Deprecated.
 * @param numChunkProducerSeats Number of chunk producers. Don't mess it up with chunk-only producers feature which is deprecated.
 * @param numChunkValidatorSeats 
 * @param onlineMaxThreshold Online maximum threshold above which validator gets full reward.
 * @param onlineMinThreshold Online minimum threshold below which validator doesn't receive reward.
 * @param protocolUpgradeStakeThreshold Threshold of stake that needs to indicate that they ready for upgrade.
 * @param shardLayout Layout information regarding how to split accounts to shards
 * @param shuffleShardAssignmentForChunkProducers If true, shuffle the chunk producers across shards. In other words, if the shard assignments were `[S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3]` where `S_i` represents the set of chunk producers for shard `i`, if this flag were true, the shard assignments might become, for example, `[S_2, S_0, S_3, S_1]`.
 * @param targetValidatorMandatesPerShard Number of target chunk validator mandates for each shard.
 * @param useProductionConfig This is only for test purposes. We hard code some configs for mainnet and testnet in AllEpochConfig, and we want to have a way to test that code path. This flag is for that. If set to true, the node will use the same config override path as mainnet and testnet.
