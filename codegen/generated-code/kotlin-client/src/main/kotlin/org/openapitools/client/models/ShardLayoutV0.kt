/**
 * A shard layout that maps accounts evenly across all shards -- by calculate the hash of account id and mod number of shards. This is added to capture the old `account_id_to_shard_id` algorithm, to keep backward compatibility for some existing tests. `parent_shards` for `ShardLayoutV1` is always `None`, meaning it can only be the first shard layout a chain uses.

 * @param version Version of the shard layout, this is useful for uniquely identify the shard layout
