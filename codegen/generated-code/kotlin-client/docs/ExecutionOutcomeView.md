## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **executorId** | **kotlin.String** | The id of the account on which the execution happens. For transaction this is signer_id, for receipt this is receiver_id. |  |
| **gasBurnt** | **kotlin.Int** | The amount of the gas burnt by the given transaction or receipt. |  |
| **logs** | **kotlin.collections.List&lt;kotlin.String&gt;** | Logs from this transaction or receipt. |  |
| **receiptIds** | **kotlin.collections.List&lt;kotlin.String&gt;** | Receipt IDs generated by this transaction or receipt. |  |
| **status** | [**ExecutionStatusView**](ExecutionStatusView.md) | Execution status. Contains the result in case of successful execution. |  |
| **tokensBurnt** | **kotlin.String** | The amount of tokens burnt corresponding to the burnt gas amount. This value doesn&#39;t always equal to the &#x60;gas_burnt&#x60; multiplied by the gas price, because the prepaid gas price might be lower than the actual gas price and it creates a deficit. &#x60;tokens_burnt&#x60; also contains the penalty subtracted from refunds, while &#x60;gas_burnt&#x60; only contains the gas that we actually burn for the execution. |  |
| **metadata** | [**ExecutionMetadataView**](ExecutionMetadataView.md) | Execution metadata, versioned |  [optional] |
